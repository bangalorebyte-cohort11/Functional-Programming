'''Functional Programming with filter(). In the Unix file system, there are always two
special files in each folder/directory: '.' indicates the current directory and '..'
represents the parent directory. Given this knowledge, take a look at the
documentation for the os.listdir() function and describe what this code snippet does:
files = filter(lambda x: x and x[0] != '.', os.
listdir(folder))'''

files = filter(lambda x: x and x[0] != '.', os.listdir(folder))
