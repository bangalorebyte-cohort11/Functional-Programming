Passing Functions. Write a sister function to the testit() function described in this chapter.
 Rather than testing execution for errors, timeit() will take a function object (along with any arguments)
 and time how long it takes to execute the function. Return the following values: function return value, time elapsed.
  You can use time.clock() or time. time(), whichever provides you with greater accuracy.
  (The general consensus is to use time.time() on POSIX and time.clock() on Win32 systems.) Note: The timeit() function is not
  related to the timeit module

import time


def measureTime():
    start = time.time()
    return map(lambda x: x * 2, range(5))
    elapsed = time.time()
    elapsed = elapsed - start
    print("Time spent  is: ", elapsed)

measureTime()
