'''
Functional Programming with map(). Write a program that takes a filename and
"cleans" the file by removing all leading and trailing whitespace from each line. Read
in the original file and write out a new one, either creating a new file or overwriting
the existing one. Give your user the option to pick which of the two to perform.
Convert your solution to using list comprehensions.

inp=int(input("Please enter option 1 to create new file and 2 re-write the existing one\n"))

if inp==1:
    newFile="newFile"
elif inp==0:
    existFile="sample_txt"
else:
    print("Enter valid input")

#with open(newFile,'w') as fnew:
#with open(existFile,'w') as fexist:

with open(newFile, 'w') as fout:
    with open(existFile, 'r') as fin:
        lst=list(map(lambda line: fout.write(line), map(lambda line: line.strip() + '\n', fin)))
    print(lst)
